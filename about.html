            Some general information to know about me. For starters, I am not a very talkative nor outgoing person. I
            prefer to keep to myself most of the time. I am currently a 16-year-old junior at Barry Goldwater High
            School in the Deer Valley Unified District & am expected to graduate in the year 2020 with nothing lower
            than a ‘B’ in all of my current subjects. Although I attend BGHS, my hometown is further south down in
            Laveen. I do have my own license & state id, but am currently unemployed & hoping to change that soon. One
            of my biggest & most passionate hobbies is music, or more specifically, singing. I wake up early in the
            morning & sleep late at night to be the most productive I possibly can. Due to my lack in leadership &
            people skills, I consider myself a follower, although with enough time & effort I believe that I could
            become an adequate leader.
