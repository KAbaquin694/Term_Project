        <h2>Compatibility</h2>
        <p>
            I am a very quiet & reserved person. I often don’t interact with others unless I have to. That’s not to say
            that I don’t work well with others, I actually get along with anyone exceptionally well. I can work by
            myself, with a partner, or with a group effectively. Although I prefer to work alone, it’s always nice to
            have someone else to share the workload & acquaint myself with. My stoicness may make me seem like I am
            apathetic & want to be alone, but I actually welcome interaction with others, even though I may not be a
            very good conversationalist or people-person. Given that I am a very open-minded person, I can work with
            just about anyone. It doesn’t matter what the person's gender is, what their style is, or even their
            reputation; I will work with them to the best of my ability. I usually just “go with the flow”. I like to
            think that this is one of the reasons that I work well with others.

        <h2>Team Player</h2>
        <p id="bottomleft">
            Whenever in a group, I always do my best to do my part & support others when & where I can. Despite my lack
            in certain communication skills, I always convey my own thoughts to the group I am working with. If it
            looks like someone is struggling, I would offer my own help to see if I could alleviate their problems. In
            the past, I did volunteer work for a non-profit organization called <a href="https://www.fmsc.org/">Feed My
                Starving Children</a> where we are divided into groups to pack food for children all over the world.
            This, of course, requires teamwork & communication. Everybody had their own jobs, from sealing the bags,
            packaging the food, to resupplying each station & could easily disrupt into chaos without any sort of
            communication. I hope to do more work, volunteer or not, that requires communication & reliability of
            others in the future.

        <h2>Professionalism</h2>
        <p>
            Being professional is important if you want to be taken seriously. Whether it be how you dress, how you
            speak, or how you talk. Compared to some of my peers at my home school, I am one of the most mature when
            need to be. I don’t often divert my attention elsewhere when working on an assignment, I do all I can in
            order to finish it with minimal distractions. Although I may lack in the speaking department, I like to
            think that I make that up when writing. I tend to get a bit carried away when I have to write about a topic
            that piques my interest. When it comes to clothing, you won’t see me wearing ripped jeans & sandals with a
            sleeveless shirt in public. Instead, I usually wear black jeans, if a bit faded, with closed-toed shoes, &
            a button-up shirt. I am willing to wear something more or less formal if the occasion requires me to do so.
